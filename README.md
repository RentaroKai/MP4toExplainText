# MotionTagger

A tool for sending videos to AI for tagging

## Overview

This is an application that analyzes video files (mp4), automatically detects actions,
and outputs them in tabular format.
Examples of output content (customizable):
- Appropriate file name
- Male/female/age
- Detailed posture
- Description of movements
- Whether it can be LOOPed or not

Since the script simply specifies in natural language
"Write XX information!", you can get the information you want
by modifying it according to your needs.

The tag information that appears on the tool screen is minimal,
but when you export to CSV, it's filled with detailed tags.

### Customizing Prompts

Instructions to AI (prompts) are externalized as JSON files and
managed in the `config/prompts/` directory.
Users can:

- Select from existing prompt templates
- Create and save new prompts
- Edit or adjust prompts

Please refer to `config/prompts/sample01.json` for prompt examples.
